# gabes examples

Hope these serve as good examples : ) I've used stuff like this on other projects so I just copied from another one and removed all the other stuff that was unnecessary / unused. Sorry about extra css and other things. Haven't tested the stuff out so I wouldn't copy and paste and expect it to run I would just use these as a guide.

For anything react I am using a newer version that lets you use hooks and makes code simpler. When I made the react site for world cup hooks weren't a thing yet so you're either going to have to use state and props in the conventional way or upgrade the react version (which is really easy since the site uses create-react-app).

I'll add stuff here NUWC needs it/ if you peoples want examples on anything else but for now this examples repo includes the following:

- Forms with formik
- AWS lambda script to send to slack and google sheets
- links to guides for:
    - google authentication/keys for sheets
    - AWS api gateway and lambdas
    - slack webhooks
